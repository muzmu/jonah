## Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Attestable Container Build will provide a monitoring service to verify network connections and file accesses during a container build process, the high level implementation will:

- **Track the whole construction of the container and ensure transparency**
- **Provide reviewable documentation of the build process**
- **Allow for efficient audits of the build process**


## Users/Personas Of The Project:

Attestable Container Build will be used by System Administrators and container builders as they go about building and launching container builds.

It targets only System Administrators and builders of containers.

It will not target end users of the built containers

## Scope and Features Of The Project:

- Ensure transparent build processes
  - A hash of the Dockerfile will be recorded
  - A hash of the built image will be recorded
  - All outside network accesses will be recorded
  - All file access and modification will be recorded
- Provide reviewable documentation from the build process
  - All data mentioned will be formatted into an attestation form
- Allow for efficient audits of the build process
  - The attestation form will be encrypted with public/private key system
  - The form will be attached to the built container image as an artifact

## Solution Concept:

### Tools to be used:
- Docker: builds container images from Dockerfiles and installed dependencies
- eBPF Hooks: points in the Linux kernel where user code can be inserted and ran on specific system actions
- oras: provides a way to attach attestation files to container images
- sha256sum: provides tool to encrypt files and get hashes from existing files to protect file validity
- GnuPG: provides a tool to encrypt files with public/private key pairs to ensure validity of files sent and received
### Possible stretch tools:
- Whaler: reverse engineers a Dockerfile from a container image, reveals files added with the ADD COPY commands and provides miscellaneous information such as user it runs as and environment variables

### Global Architectural Structure Of the Project: 

### Key Design Decisions:
- BPF System action capture: Linuxâ€™s BPF system is an extremely lightweight and powerful system that our design can leverage to capture any system action during the build process. While it will also possibly capture outside actionos not pertaining to the build process, we thought it preferable to filter through the excess data than to build a completely custom monitoring system specifically for Dockerfile monitoring.
- Attachment to build image as an artifact: oras allows us to efficiently link the attestation file to the container image without consuming excess data or processing power. Attaching it to the build image itself also assists in later audits as only one file need be located.
- Public/Private key encryption: 


## Acceptance criteria:

### Minimum Viable Product:

Background monitor system able to attach system actions to the finished build image in a formatted attestation file. 

### Stretch goals:

- Connect each system action to its specific line in the Dockerfile
- Detect irregularities in subsequent builds to detect tampering of the Dockerfile
- Use Whaler to reverse engineer the Dockerfile and check any irregularities in it versus the attestation document
